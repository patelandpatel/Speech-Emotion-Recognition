I see you've uploaded a file named **speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb**. I'll create a README file based on the structure of the project in your notebook. Let me review the file and provide the README.

Based on the extracted content from your Jupyter Notebook, I’ll create a detailed **README.md** file for your repository:

# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

This repository contains a project on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**, which uses deep learning techniques to identify human emotions based on speech signals. The goal is to classify speech into various emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, using datasets like CREMA-D, RAVDESS, SAVEE, and TESS.

## Overview
**Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** is the process of identifying emotions and affective states from human speech. This project capitalizes on the fact that tone and pitch often reflect underlying emotions, enabling practical applications in various industries.

## Motivation
### Why is SER important?
1. **Call Centers**: Classify calls based on emotions to improve customer satisfaction and identify unsatisfied customers.
2. **In-Car Systems**: Detect the driver's emotional state to ensure safety and prevent accidents.
3. **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enhance user experience by creating emotionally responsive systems.

### Why Deep Learning?
Deep learning models offer higher accuracy and adaptability for complex speech recognition tasks compared to traditional machine learning techniques.

## Datasets Used
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **[CREMA-D](https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D)**: Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset.
2. **[RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976)**: Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song.
3. **[SAVEE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee)**: Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion Dataset.
4. **[TESS](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487)**: Toronto Emotional Speech Set.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Feature extraction using **MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**.
- Model training using deep learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance on multiple datasets.
- Real-time prediction support.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Librosa** for audio processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training deep learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb
   ```

3. Train the model:
   Modify the notebook to load your datasets and run the training pipeline.

4. Evaluate the model:
   Use the evaluation metrics provided in the notebook to analyze performance.

## Results
Key results include:
- Emotion classification accuracy: **X%** (replace with actual accuracy).
- Confusion matrices and performance graphs are available in the notebook.
